Wut is OpenAIEmbeddings used for?,"['How to Generate Synthetic Data for RAG Evaluation In the world of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM-powered applications, synthetic data generation is a game-changer for rapid iteration and robust evaluation. This blog post explains why synthetic data is essential, and how you can generate it for your own RAG pipelines—using modern tools like RAGAS and LangSmith. Why Generate Synthetic Data? Early Signal, Fast Iteration Real-world data is often scarce or expensive to label. Synthetic data lets you quickly create test sets that mimic real user queries and contexts, so you can evaluate your system’s performance before deploying to production. Controlled Complexity You can design synthetic datasets to cover edge cases, multi-hop reasoning, or specific knowledge domains—ensuring your RAG system is robust, not just good at the “easy” cases. Benchmarking and Comparison Synthetic test sets provide a repeatable, comparable way to measure improvements as you tweak your pipeline (e.g., changing chunk size, embeddings, or prompts). How to Generate Synthetic Data 1. Prepare Your Source Data Start with a set of documents relevant to your domain. For example, you might download and load HTML blog posts into a document format using tools like LangChain’s DirectoryLoader. 2. Build a Knowledge Graph Use RAGAS to convert your documents into a knowledge graph. This graph captures entities, relationships, and summaries, forming the backbone for generating meaningful queries. RAGAS applies default transformations are dependent on the corpus length, here are some examples: Producing Summaries -> produces summaries of the documents Extracting Headlines -> finding the overall headline for the document Theme Extractor -> extracts broad themes about the documents It then uses cosine-similarity and heuristics between the embeddings of the above transformations to construct relationships between the nodes. This is a crucial step, as the quality of your knowledge graph directly impacts the relevance and accuracy of the generated queries. 3. Configure Query Synthesizers RAGAS provides several query synthesizers: - SingleHopSpecificQuerySynthesizer: Generates direct, fact-based questions. - MultiHopAbstractQuerySynthesizer: Creates broader, multi-step reasoning questions. - MultiHopSpecificQuerySynthesizer: Focuses on questions that require connecting specific entities across documents. By mixing these, you get a diverse and challenging test set. 4. Generate the Test Set With your knowledge graph and query synthesizers, use RAGAS’s TestsetGenerator to create a synthetic dataset. This dataset will include questions, reference answers, and supporting contexts. 5. Evaluate and Iterate Load your synthetic dataset into an evaluation platform like LangSmith. Run your RAG pipeline against the test set, and use automated evaluators (for accuracy, helpfulness, style, etc.) to identify strengths and weaknesses. Tweak your pipeline and re-evaluate to drive improvements. Minimal Example Here’s a high-level pseudocode outline (see the notebook for full details): ````python 1. Load documents from langchain_community.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader path = ""data/"" loader = DirectoryLoader(path, glob=""*.md"") docs = loader.load() 2.

Now, let\'s focus specifically on evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which present unique evaluation challenges due to their multi-component nature. Understanding RAG Systems: More Than the Sum of Their Parts RAG systems combine two critical capabilities: 1. Retrieval: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base 2. Generation: Creating coherent, accurate responses based on retrieved information This dual nature means evaluation must address both components while also assessing their interaction. A system might retrieve perfect information but generate poor responses, or generate excellent prose from irrelevant retrieved content. The RAG Evaluation Triad Effective RAG evaluation requires examining three key dimensions: Retrieval Quality: How well does the system find relevant information? Generation Quality: How well does the system produce responses from retrieved information? End-to-End Performance: How well does the complete system satisfy user needs? Let\'s explore how Ragas helps evaluate each dimension of RAG systems.', ""<2-hop>\n\nCore RAG Metrics in Ragas Ragas provides specialized metrics to assess RAG systems across retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance. Retrieval Quality Metrics 1. Context Relevancy Measures how relevant the retrieved documents are to the user's question. How it works: Takes the user's question (user_input) and the retrieved documents (retrieved_contexts). Uses an LLM to score relevance with two different prompts, averaging the results for robustness. Scores are normalized between 0.0 (irrelevant) and 1.0 (fully relevant). Why it matters: Low scores indicate your retriever is pulling in unrelated or noisy documents. Monitoring this helps you improve the retrieval step. 2. Context Precision Assesses how much of the retrieved context is actually useful for generating the answer. How it works: For each retrieved chunk, an LLM judges if it was necessary for the answer, using the ground truth (reference) or the generated response. Calculates Average Precision, rewarding systems that rank useful chunks higher. Variants: ContextUtilization: Uses the generated response instead of ground truth. Non-LLM version: Compares retrieved chunks to ideal reference contexts using string similarity. Why it matters: High precision means your retriever is efficient; low precision means too much irrelevant information is included. 3. Context Recall Evaluates whether all necessary information from the ground truth answer is present in the retrieved context. How it works: Breaks down the reference answer into sentences. For each sentence, an LLM checks if it can be supported by the retrieved context. The score is the proportion of reference sentences attributed to the retrieved context. Variants: Non-LLM version: Compares reference and retrieved contexts using similarity and thresholds. Why it matters: High recall means your retriever finds all needed information; low recall means critical information is missing. Summary: - Low context relevancy: Retriever needs better query understanding or semantic matching. - Low context precision: Retriever includes unnecessary information. - Low context recall: Retriever misses critical information. Generation Quality Metrics 1. Faithfulness Checks if the generated answer is factually consistent with the retrieved context, addressing hallucination. How it works: Breaks the answer into simple statements. For each, an LLM checks if it can be inferred from the retrieved context. The score is the proportion of faithful statements. Alternative: FaithfulnesswithHHEM: Uses a specialized NLI model for verification. Why it matters: High faithfulness means answers are grounded in context; low faithfulness signals hallucination. 2. Answer Relevancy Measures if the generated answer directly addresses the user's question. How it works: Asks an LLM to generate possible questions for the answer. Compares these to the original question using embedding similarity. Penalizes noncommittal answers. Why it matters: High relevancy means answers are on-topic; low relevancy means answers are off-topic or incomplete. Summary: - Low faithfulness: Generator adds facts not supported by context. - Low answer relevancy: Generator doesn't focus on the specific question. End-to-End Metrics 1. Correctness Assesses factual alignment between the generated answer and a ground truth reference. How it works: Breaks both the answer and reference into claims. Uses NLI to verify claims in both directions. Calculates precision, recall, or F1-score. Why it matters: High correctness means answers match the ground truth; low correctness signals factual errors. Key distinction: - Faithfulness: Compares answer to retrieved context. - FactualCorrectness: Compares answer to ground truth."", '<3-hop>\n\ntitle: ""Part 1: Introduction to Ragas: The Essential Evaluation Framework for LLM Applications"" date: 2025-04-26T18:00:00-06:00 layout: blog description: ""Explore the essential evaluation framework for LLM applications with Ragas.

"How does RAGAS facilitate metric-driven development in RAG system evaluation, and what specific metrics does it introduce to improve the assessment process?","['<1-hop>\n\nHow to Generate Synthetic Data for RAG Evaluation In the world of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM-powered applications, synthetic data generation is a game-changer for rapid iteration and robust evaluation. This blog post explains why synthetic data is essential, and how you can generate it for your own RAG pipelines—using modern tools like RAGAS and LangSmith. Why Generate Synthetic Data? Early Signal, Fast Iteration Real-world data is often scarce or expensive to label. Synthetic data lets you quickly create test sets that mimic real user queries and contexts, so you can evaluate your system’s performance before deploying to production. Controlled Complexity You can design synthetic datasets to cover edge cases, multi-hop reasoning, or specific knowledge domains—ensuring your RAG system is robust, not just good at the “easy” cases. Benchmarking and Comparison Synthetic test sets provide a repeatable, comparable way to measure improvements as you tweak your pipeline (e.g., changing chunk size, embeddings, or prompts). How to Generate Synthetic Data 1. Prepare Your Source Data Start with a set of documents relevant to your domain. For example, you might download and load HTML blog posts into a document format using tools like LangChain’s DirectoryLoader. 2. Build a Knowledge Graph Use RAGAS to convert your documents into a knowledge graph. This graph captures entities, relationships, and summaries, forming the backbone for generating meaningful queries. RAGAS applies default transformations are dependent on the corpus length, here are some examples: Producing Summaries -> produces summaries of the documents Extracting Headlines -> finding the overall headline for the document Theme Extractor -> extracts broad themes about the documents It then uses cosine-similarity and heuristics between the embeddings of the above transformations to construct relationships between the nodes. This is a crucial step, as the quality of your knowledge graph directly impacts the relevance and accuracy of the generated queries. 3. Configure Query Synthesizers RAGAS provides several query synthesizers: - SingleHopSpecificQuerySynthesizer: Generates direct, fact-based questions. - MultiHopAbstractQuerySynthesizer: Creates broader, multi-step reasoning questions. - MultiHopSpecificQuerySynthesizer: Focuses on questions that require connecting specific entities across documents. By mixing these, you get a diverse and challenging test set. 4. Generate the Test Set With your knowledge graph and query synthesizers, use RAGAS’s TestsetGenerator to create a synthetic dataset. This dataset will include questions, reference answers, and supporting contexts. 5. Evaluate and Iterate Load your synthetic dataset into an evaluation platform like LangSmith. Run your RAG pipeline against the test set, and use automated evaluators (for accuracy, helpfulness, style, etc.) to identify strengths and weaknesses. Tweak your pipeline and re-evaluate to drive improvements. Minimal Example Here’s a high-level pseudocode outline (see the notebook for full details): ````python 1. Load documents from langchain_community.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader path = ""data/"" loader = DirectoryLoader(path, glob=""*.md"") docs = loader.load() 2.

Whether you\'re developing AI systems, building web applications, or managing projects, having clear metrics guides your team toward meaningful progress while eliminating subjective debates. The Power of Metrics in AI Evaluation Recent advances in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) highlight the critical importance of proper evaluation frameworks. Projects like RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment System) demonstrate how specialized metrics can transform vague goals into actionable insights. For example, when evaluating retrieval-augmented generation systems, generic metrics like BLEU or ROUGE scores often fail to capture what truly matters - the accuracy, relevance, and contextual understanding of the generated responses. RAGAS instead introduces metrics specifically designed for RAG systems: Faithfulness: Measures how well the generated answer aligns with the retrieved context Answer Relevancy: Evaluates whether the response correctly addresses the user\'s query Context Relevancy: Assesses if the system retrieves information that\'s actually needed Context Precision: Quantifies how efficiently the system uses retrieved information These targeted metrics provide clearer direction than general-purpose evaluations, allowing teams to make precise improvements where they matter most. Imagine two teams building a new feature for a streaming platform: Team A is stuck in debates. Should they focus on improving video load speed or making the recommendation engine more accurate? One engineer insists, ""Faster videos keep users from leaving!"" Another counters, ""But better recommendations are what make them subscribe!"" They argue based on gut feelings. Team B operates differently. They have a clear, agreed-upon goal: Improve the average ""Watch Time per User"" metric, while ensuring video buffering times stay below 2 seconds. They rapidly test ideas, measuring the impact of each change against this specific target. Which team do you think will make faster, smarter progress? Team B has the edge because they\'re using Metric-Driven Development (MDD). This is a powerful strategy where teams unite around measurable goals to eliminate guesswork and make real strides. Let\'s break down how it works, what makes a metric truly useful, and see how industries from healthcare to e-commerce use it to succeed. What Exactly is Metric-Driven Development? Metric-Driven Development (MDD) is a simple but effective framework where teams: Define Clear, Measurable Goals: Set specific numerical targets (e.g., ""Increase user sign-ups by 20% this quarter""). Base Decisions on Data: Rely on evidence and measurements, not just opinions or assumptions. Iterate and Learn Quickly: Continuously measure the impact of changes to see what works and what doesn\'t. Think of MDD as a GPS for your project. Without clear metrics, you\'re driving in the fog, hoping you\'re heading in the right direction. With MDD, you get real-time feedback, ensuring you\'re moving towards your destination efficiently. Why Teams Struggle Without Clear Metrics Without a metric-driven approach, teams often fall into common traps: Chasing Too Many Goals: Trying to improve everything at once (""We need higher accuracy and faster speed and lower costs!"") leads to scattered effort and slow progress. Endless Subjective Debates: Arguments arise that are hard to resolve with data (""Is Model A\'s slightly better performance worth the extra complexity?""). Difficulty Measuring Progress: It\'s hard to know if you\'re actually improving (""Are we doing better than last quarter? How can we be sure?""). In machine learning (ML), this often happens when teams track various technical scores (like precision, recall, or F1 score – measures of model accuracy) without a single, unifying metric tied to the actual business outcome they want to achieve.']","RAGAS facilitates metric-driven development in RAG system evaluation by providing tools to generate synthetic datasets and by introducing specialized metrics tailored for RAG systems.

Now, let\'s dive into one of Ragas\' most powerful capabilities: advanced metrics and custom evaluation approaches that address specialized evaluation needs. Beyond the Basics: Why Advanced Metrics Matter While Ragas\' core metrics cover fundamental evaluation aspects, real-world applications often have unique requirements: Domain-specific quality criteria: Legal, medical, or financial applications have specialized accuracy requirements Custom interaction patterns: Applications with unique conversation flows need tailored evaluation approaches Specialized capabilities: Features like reasoning, code generation, or structured output demand purpose-built metrics Business-specific KPIs: Aligning evaluation with business objectives requires customized metrics Let\'s explore how to extend Ragas\' capabilities to meet these specialized needs. Understanding Ragas\' Metric Architecture Before creating custom metrics, it\'s helpful to understand Ragas\' metric architecture: 1. Understand the Metric Base Classes All metrics in Ragas inherit from the abstract Metric class (see metrics/base.py). For most use cases, you’ll extend one of these: SingleTurnMetric: For metrics that evaluate a single question/response pair. MultiTurnMetric: For metrics that evaluate multi-turn conversations. MetricWithLLM: For metrics that require an LLM for evaluation. MetricWithEmbeddings: For metrics that use embeddings. You can mix these as needed (e.g., MetricWithLLM, SingleTurnMetric). Each metric implements specific scoring methods depending on its type: _single_turn_ascore: For single-turn metrics _multi_turn_ascore: For multi-turn metrics Creating Your First Custom Metric Let\'s create a custom metric that evaluates technical accuracy in programming explanations: ```python from dataclasses import dataclass, field from typing import Dict, Optional, Set import typing as t from ragas.metrics.base import MetricWithLLM, SingleTurnMetric from ragas.prompt import PydanticPrompt from ragas.metrics import MetricType, MetricOutputType from pydantic import BaseModel Define input/output models for the prompt class TechnicalAccuracyInput(BaseModel): question: str context: str response: str programming_language: str = ""python"" class TechnicalAccuracyOutput(BaseModel): score: float feedback: str Define the prompt class TechnicalAccuracyPrompt(PydanticPrompt[TechnicalAccuracyInput, TechnicalAccuracyOutput]): instruction: str = ( ""Evaluate the technical accuracy of the response to a programming question. "" ""Consider syntax correctness, algorithmic accuracy, and best practices."" ) input_model = TechnicalAccuracyInput output_model = TechnicalAccuracyOutput examples = [ # Add examples here ] Create the metric @dataclass class TechnicalAccuracy(MetricWithLLM, SingleTurnMetric): name: str = ""technical_accuracy"" _required_columns: Dict[MetricType, Set[str]] = field( default_factory=lambda: { MetricType.SINGLE_TURN: { ""user_input"", ""response"", } } ) output_type: Optional[MetricOutputType] = MetricOutputType.CONTINUOUS evaluation_prompt: PydanticPrompt = field(default_factory=TechnicalAccuracyPrompt) async def _single_turn_ascore(self, sample, callbacks) -> float: assert self.llm is not None, ""LLM must be set"" question = sample.user_input response = sample.response # Extract programming language from question if possible programming_language = ""python"" # Default languages = [""python"", ""javascript"", ""java"", ""c++"", ""rust"", ""go""] for lang in languages: if lang in question.lower(): programming_language = lang break # Get the context context = ""\\n"".join(sample.retrieved_contexts) if sample.retrieved_contexts else """" # Prepare input for prompt prompt_input = TechnicalAccuracyInput( question=question, context=context, response=response, programming_language=programming_language ) # Generate evaluation evaluation = await self.evaluation_prompt.generate( data=prompt_input, llm=self.llm, callbacks=callbacks ) return evaluation.score ``` Using the Custom Metric To use the custom metric, simply include it in your evaluation pipeline: ```python from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI from ragas import SingleTurnSample from ragas.llms import LangchainLLMWrapper Initialize the LLM, you are going to OPENAI API key evaluator_llm = LangchainLLMWrapper(ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4o"")) test_data = { ""user_input"": ""Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number in Python."", ""retrieved_contexts"": [""Python is a programming language."", ""A factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.""], ""response"": ""def factorial(n):\\n if n == 0:\\n return 1\\n else:\\n return n * factorial(n-1)"", } Create a sample sample = SingleTurnSample(**test_data) # Unpack the dictionary into the constructor technical_accuracy = TechnicalAccuracy(llm=evaluator_llm) score = await technical_accuracy.single_turn_ascore(sample) print(f""Technical Accuracy Score: {score}"") Note: The above code is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle exceptions, `` You can also use theevaluate` function to evaluate a dataset: ```python from ragas import evaluate from ragas import evaluate results = evaluate( dataset, # Your dataset of samples metrics=[TechnicalAccuracy(), ...], llm=myevaluator_llm_llm ) ``` 💡 Try it yourself: Explore the hands-on notebook for synthetic data generation: 05_Advanced_Metrics_and_Customization']","ChatOpenAI can be integrated into a RAG evaluation pipeline for both synthetic data generation and advanced metric evaluation using Ragas by following a series of steps outlined in the provided context. First, for synthetic data generation, you initialize the generator with the LLM and embedding model by wrapping ChatOpenAI (for example, with LangchainLLMWrapper using ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4.1"")) and OpenAIEmbeddings. This setup is used with Ragas’s TestsetGenerator to create a synthetic dataset containing questions, answers, and contexts for RAG evaluation. Second, for advanced metric evaluation, ChatOpenAI can be used as the underlying LLM in custom metrics within Ragas. For instance, when creating a custom metric such as TechnicalAccuracy, you initialize the evaluator LLM with LangchainLLMWrapper(ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4o"")), and use it to score responses based on criteria like syntax correctness and algorithmic accuracy. The key steps are: (1) loading and preparing source documents, (2) initializing the LLM and embedding models with ChatOpenAI, (3) generating synthetic datasets with Ragas, and (4) evaluating the datasets using both built-in and custom metrics powered by ChatOpenAI as the LLM. This approach enables robust, repeatable evaluation and supports both standard and domain-specific assessment needs.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Now, let\'s focus specifically on evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which present unique evaluation challenges due to their multi-component nature. Understanding RAG Systems: More Than the Sum of Their Parts RAG systems combine two critical capabilities: 1. Retrieval: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base 2. Generation: Creating coherent, accurate responses based on retrieved information This dual nature means evaluation must address both components while also assessing their interaction. A system might retrieve perfect information but generate poor responses, or generate excellent prose from irrelevant retrieved content. The RAG Evaluation Triad Effective RAG evaluation requires examining three key dimensions: Retrieval Quality: How well does the system find relevant information? Generation Quality: How well does the system produce responses from retrieved information? End-to-End Performance: How well does the complete system satisfy user needs? Let\'s explore how Ragas helps evaluate each dimension of RAG systems.']","Ragas facilitates the comprehensive evaluation of RAG systems by providing specialized metrics that assess both the retrieval and generation components. For RAG systems, Ragas evaluates retrieval quality (how well relevant information is found), generation quality (how accurately and coherently responses are produced from retrieved information), and end-to-end performance (how well the system satisfies user needs). This approach ensures that both the individual components and their interaction are thoroughly assessed. When evaluating more complex AI agents, Ragas extends its evaluation with additional specialized metrics for goal accuracy, tool call accuracy, and topic adherence, reflecting the increased sophistication required for agents that engage in multi-turn interactions, use tools, and work toward specific goals.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
