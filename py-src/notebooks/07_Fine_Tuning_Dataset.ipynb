         "## What is Ragas?\n\n[Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/) is an open-source evaluation framework specifically designed for LLM applications, with particular strengths in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Unlike traditional NLP evaluation methods, Ragas provides specialized metrics that address the unique challenges of LLM-powered systems.\n\nAt its core, Ragas helps answer crucial questions:\n- Is my application retrieving the right information?\n- Are the responses factually accurate and consistent with the retrieved context?\n- Does the system appropriately address the user's query?\n- How well does my application handle multi-turn conversations?\n\n## Why Evaluate LLM Applications?\n\nLLMs are powerful but imperfect. They can hallucinate facts, misinterpret queries, or generate convincing but incorrect responses. For applications where accuracy and reliability matter—like healthcare, finance, or education—proper evaluation is non-negotiable."
