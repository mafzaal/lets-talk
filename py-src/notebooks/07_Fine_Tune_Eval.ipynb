Synthetic data lets you quickly create test sets that mimic real user queries and contexts, so you can evaluate your system’s performance before deploying to production.\\n\\n2. **Controlled Complexity**  \\n   You can design synthetic datasets to cover edge cases, multi-hop reasoning, or specific knowledge domains—ensuring your RAG system is robust, not just good at the “easy” cases.', '<2-hop>\\n\\n## The Origin of \"Data is King\"\\n\\nPeter Norvig famously stated, \"We don\\'t have better algorithms. We just have more data.\" This statement emerged during a time when Google\\'s approach to machine translation was yielding surprisingly effective results not through algorithmic innovations, but through the sheer volume of multilingual data they had amassed. \\n\\nThis perspective represented a paradigm shift. Prior to this, the field had largely focused on crafting ever more sophisticated algorithms, with the assumption that smarter code would yield better results.

This approach increases the quantity of data available for evaluation, supporting robust system development. According to Peter Norvig's perspective, as described in the context, the importance of data quantity represents a paradigm shift: rather than relying solely on more sophisticated algorithms, having more data—even with simpler algorithms—can lead to better results. Thus, synthetic data generation aligns with this shift by providing the large datasets necessary to improve system performance.",

To create a custom metric for evaluating technical accuracy in programming explanations, Ragas allows developers to define input and output models (for example, using Pydantic BaseModel classes for technical accuracy input and output), and implement the metric logic using its extensible metric classes. This enables tailored evaluation beyond traditional NLP metrics, supporting the needs of high-stakes LLM applications.",
